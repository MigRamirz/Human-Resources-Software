## Code detalis:

Human Resources Software (HRS) allows list, delete, and set a new contestant if there is a least one contestant and if the ID exists in the file serializable, also allows add new contestant if the ID doesn't exists in the same, so manage the possiblee exceptions and save the data well. In conclusion works correctly.

finally program is:
- Commented
- Has Class Diagram
- JavaDoc

If you have any nonconformity or doubt, just comment me, sorry if I merge code in the main branch. I hope HRS gets nice for you ;D
